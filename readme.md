STEPS

*USE ONLY RUFUS TO MAKE USB BOOTABLE NO OTHER TOOL.*

1) DOWNLOAD THE LATEST (RUFUS) USB BOOTABLE MAKING TOOL  ( DONT USE BALENA ETCHER OR OTHER TOOLS TO MAKE BOOTABLE THAT WILL NOT WORK)

2) OPEN RUFUS FROM Justatech Checkra1n 0.12.4 Windows and make bootable . ( only use the rufus i provided because it has important linux sys files that are important for make usb bootable )

3) MAKE SURE YOU CONNECTED TO INTERNET WHILE MAKING THE USB BOOTABLE FIRST TIME
BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE THE (RUFUS TOOL) FIRST TIME IT WILL DOWNLOAD THE REQUIRED
LIBRARIES FILES FOR MAKING USB BOOTABLE.

4) AFTER COMPLETE PROCESS REBOOT YOUR MACHINE.

5) YOU CAN CHOOSE 

BOOT FROM UEFI ( FOR NEW PC WITH UEFI SUPPORT )
OR
BOOT FROM LEGACY BIOS ( FOR OLD PC , NO SUPPORT OF UEFI )

6) IT WORKS ON BOTH AMD / INTEL [ 64/32x BIT MACHINES ] , MACOS , LINUX OS ALSO.

7) SELET YOUR USB AND THEN WAIT AFTER 5 SECONDS IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOAD THE CHECKRA1N .

8) EASY TO USE PLUG AND RUN LIGHT IN SIZE .

IN NEXT UPDATE I WILL MAKE THE FILE SIZE MORE LESS.
